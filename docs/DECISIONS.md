# DECISIONS.md

ADR-lite decision log. Append only. Newest at the bottom.

Record any decision that a future session could plausibly reverse by accident.

Format:

```

Why:
The reasoning.

Rejected:
What we considered and why not.
```

## 2026-09-01 — Authentication

Decision:
Use Better Auth with PostgreSQL.

Why:
We want auth data in Postgres without implementing
password/session security ourselves.

Rejected:
Clerk — external user store.
Custom auth — unnecessary security risk.

SUPERSEDED by 2026-09-03 — Database and auth provider.

## 2026-09-01 — Aura

Decision:
Use Elo with K=24.

Why:
Simple, understandable and sufficient for MVP.

## 2026-09-02 — Sponsored creators

Decision:
Creators cannot pay for additional battle exposure.

Why:
Paid exposure could undermine trust in rankings.

## 2026-09-03 — Database and auth provider

Decision:
Use Supabase for both Postgres and auth. Drizzle still owns the schema and
migrations; Supabase Auth owns `auth.users`.

Why:
One third-party service for database and auth instead of two. Auth data sits
next to application data in the same Postgres, and we do not implement
password/session security ourselves.

Consequences:
RLS must be enabled and deny-by-default on every table in `public` — Supabase
exposes Postgres over a public API, so the server-only service role key is what
keeps Aura unwritable from the client.
Supabase Realtime, Storage, and Edge Functions are not adopted in V1. Images
stay on Vercel Blob.

Rejected:
Neon + Better Auth — two services to run and wire together.
Clerk — external user store, auth data outside our Postgres.
